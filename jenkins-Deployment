For jenkins server we can take Instance type as a (t2.micro).
For Sonarqube we must take Instance type as a *t2.medium*.
Where for Nexus also the Instance type as a *t2.medium*.

After this we have to run our nexus and sonarqube.
Now Login to jenkins.
Go to jenkins--Create New job.

Then scroll down--clk on--pipeline syntax genarator.
Copy the Genarated syntax and paste in pipeline script.
Now to Build the code we have to install maven in jenkins server.
Again go pipeline syntax--select the Artifactor as *shell.Script*.
Here you will get the Pipeline syntax.
Copy and paste the syntax in pipeline script.
Now Save and Build the code.
After successful of code Proced the Sonarqube.
