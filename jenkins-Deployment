Jenkins Deployment
First in the backend we have to take saparate server for each tool(like *jenkins, Sonarqube and Nexus For sapparetly*).
For jenkins server we can take Instance type as a (t2.micro).
For Sonarqube we must take Instance type as a *t2.medium*.
Where for Nexus also the Instance type as a *t2.medium*.
For Sonarqube and Nexus we have take sapparate users(*we have to install our sonarqube and nexus in the added user).
After this we have to run our nexus and sonarqube.
Now Login to jenkins.
Go to jenkins--Create New job.
Select the Job as a Pipeline.
Now Configuer the pipeline using pipeline script(Groovy script).
First we have to clone our code from git.
To clone we have Scroll down--clk on pipeline syntax--select the Artifactor as *git.github*.
Then enter the URL of the Source code from github.
Then scroll down--clk on--pipeline syntax genarator.
Copy the Genarated syntax and paste in pipeline script.
Now to Build the code we have to install maven in jenkins server.
Again go pipeline syntax--select the Artifactor as *shell.Script*.
Here you will get the Pipeline syntax.
Copy and paste the syntax in pipeline script.
Now Save and Build the code.
After successful of code Proced the Sonarqube.
To do sonarqube we have firtst install the sonarqube scannar in plugins.
To install the sonarqube Plugin Go to *Manage Jenkins---clk on *Plugins*---clk on *Availabel plugins*.
In search box search as sonarqube you will get the sonarqube scanner and the clk on check box and install.
After installing you will get massage as restart or Go back.
Go back and Search for nexus Artifactor and install nexus Artifactor uplodar.
Now restart the jenkins.
Now go back to the Backend of the Sonarqube, satrt the sonaqube and Login in sonarqube console using port number *9000*.
Give *users*--admin, Password--admin.
Now create your own password.
Now loging the jenkins.
Now configure the Sonarqube in job.
Go to *Configure*---clk on *Pipleline syntax*---now select the sonarqube environment Scanner.
Give the *Host(URL of the sonarqube).
Now Give the credentional: clk on *Add*--*user name*=select *User name and Secrete text*.
Go to the Sonarqube Console: *My Account*---clk on *Security*---Give any name and clk on Genarate. Here you will get the Secrete.
Copy the Secrete text and paste in the Jenkins Credentional(*Secrete text==Paste the copied secrete text from sonarqube).
Now clk on Add.
Now clk on Pipeline syntax genarate.
Copy the syntax and paste in pipeline script and Save and clk on Build Now.
After Sonarqube get Successful. You will get the Code details in sonaqube console(whether it as any bugs and syntax error).
Now go to the Nexus Console and Creat one repository.
Now folow the same step as sonarqube but in the Artifctor selecto the nexus Artifact uploader.
Now give the Versioin Nexus3 and Give the Creadentional of your nexus.
Now clk on Genaret pipeline syntax and copy the syntax.
Paste the syntax and clk on Save.
After successful go to the Nexus. Here In nexus you will get Source code in the repository which you created.
Now you have to depoly your Source code.
Install the Tomcat in the backend in jenkins and Change the port number as your wish.
Now start the tomcat server and go to the Console and Give the creadentional, Login.
Now Go to the jenkins.
In Jenkins go to the Plugins search as a deploy as a contenor and Restart the jenkins.
Now Go to configure and clk on pipesyntax genarator and select deploy adapters.
Now Copy the url from the tomcat server and paste it in Host Box.
Now Add the credentional of the tomcat and clk on add.
Click on genarate pipeline syntax.
Copy and paste the syntax in Script and Save.
Click on Build.
In tomcat Console click on file which you uploaded in the Jenkins.
Now you will the Final Output.
