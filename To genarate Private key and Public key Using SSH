Configuring the Slave Node using ssh key
1.	First Loging to the Jenkins server.
2.	update the packages of server(apt update).
3.	Make sure that you must be in ubunto user.
4.	Give the Command called (ssh-keygen) and Enter

7.	Go to the .ssh dirctory in Jenkins slave server Paste the Public key in authorized_keys file(using vi authorized_keys).
8.	Make sure that you must paste the Public key(id_ed25519.pub) in Ubunto user not in root user.

10.	Go to the DashBoard---Manage Jenkins---Nodes---New Nodes.
11.	Create new Node.
12.	Name==Any name
13.	Description===Any description
14.	Number of executors== Your wish of executors
15.	Remote root directory==/home/ubuntu(give the Directory path were you want create workspaces.)
16.	Labels===Any name
17.	Usage==Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node
18.	Launch method===Launch agents via SSH
19.	Here You have to give Credentails deatails Given Below.
20.	Host==Public IP adress of Server
21.	Credentials--clk on Add--clk on Jenkins.
